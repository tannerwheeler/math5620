**Consider the elliptic ODE where k(x) is a known coefficient function that does not depend on the solution. Define the value at the grid lines - half way between the nodes using the mesh points.  Write a code to compute the finite difference approximate solution. ... Use a random distribution of values between 10 and 50 to define k(x).**           ....
